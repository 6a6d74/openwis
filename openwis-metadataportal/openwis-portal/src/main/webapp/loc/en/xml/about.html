			The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has been working for several years towards upgrading its global infrastructure to support all of its international programmes of work, both operational and research-based, to collect, share and disseminate information. The new infrastructure is called the WIS, the WMO Information System, and identifies three top-level functions. These are: 
			<ul>
				<li>GISC: Global Information System Centre;</li>
				<li>DCPC: Data Collection or Production Centre;</li>
				<li>NC: National Centre.</li>
			</ul>
			All three functions contribute to the circulation of priority data, system wide security, monitoring and implementation of WMO data policies. GISCs, DCPCs and NCs allow the Discovery Access and Retrieval of data, products and services offered by WIS Centres over the world.
			KMA was designated as 「GISC Seoul」 in 2012. Since 2013, it has been operated with OpenWIS which was developed as dedicated software by KMA(Korea), Met.Office(U.K.), MF(France), MFI(France) and BoM(Australia).
			Recently, KMA customized the latest versioned OpenWIS to serve various metadata of GEOSS so that users can take not only meteorological data but also non-meteorological ones for better social and economical community.

				enhancing the spatial information exchange and sharing between
				organizations and their audience, using the capacities of the

				facilitating a wide community of spatial information users to have
				easy and timely access to available spatial data and to existing
				thematic maps that might support informed decision making.
