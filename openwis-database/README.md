This project builds the openwis database code (That is all of the tables with an openwis_prefix which make up part of the overall schema used within the openwis Application)

The remaining portion of the scehma is created in the metadataportal project which includes the geonetwork elements to the openwis schema (These additional tables can be identified as they are not prefixed with openwis_)
